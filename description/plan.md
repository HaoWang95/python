## Our learning plan
#### What we have completed
* **Pythonic Thining**
    * know python version
    * pep 8 guide
    * ...
* **Python function**
* **List and dict**

#### In progress
* **Comprehension and generator**

#### What's coming next
* **Classes and interfaces** (More hints)
* **Metaclasses and attributes**
    *  The two sections above will contain quite lots of information on double-score methods. Like __call__, __enter__,
__something__(),
* Concurrency and parallelism(A pretty advanced feature)
    * In our daily usage of Python, like(in Flask or Django)
* Robustness and performance(Write solid and robust code in Python)
* Testing and debugging(We will illustrate in later series, like when we use Flask)

#### Next semester
* Web fundamentals (HTML(Skeleton of web pages), CSS(Make the web page/html elements stylish))
    * We will try to eliminate our time on this part as we need to spend more time on Sth important.
    * How to use Flask(Web Framework)
        * Use command line to establish a Flask app
        * Use flask to render our web pages
        * Build forms to process our web app logic(eg, search something in the web page)
        * Use a database to store our data
        * Find and use Flask plugins.
* Your own choice 
    * Another very famous and even more popular framework called Django(Python)
        * Why not Django first, more opinionated.
        
#### Use Python
* Basic programming (A very user-friendly programming language, and a very convenient general-purpose programming lang)
    * There are some other programming languages
        * Java(static) -> Back end web services(Netflix uses quite lots of Java and they even published their own Java packages)
        * C#(static) -> Microsoft's Java, more elegant syntax. (Unity, a famous game engine, supports C#)
        * GoLang(static) -> Clear syntax, support concurrency by nature, and it's dominating in Cloud native architectures.(
        Because GoLang is used to build cloud native infrastructures like **Kubernetes** and its corresponding ecosystem
        )
        * C/C++(static) -> High-computing, OS, embedded system, game dev, database etc.(Library, packages) Memory control
        * JavaScript(dynamic) -> Front end web development, web scripting. Most used programming language.(Node.js for backend)
        * Python(dynamic) -> AI, Data Analysis, machine learning/deep learning. (What these require are Mathematics)
            * Python can also be used in Web Dev(Backend, or Full stack).
            * Dynamic, python scripting tools to automate tasks.(Process excel, process logs, testing)
         * Rust -> Replace C++. Rust is gaining quite popular in the past 2 years. 
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning & AI
* Web dev -> Flask(A well-designed micro framework). Django(A fullstack web framework)
* Data processing and analysis(A library called **pandas**)

Package management tool:
Java: Maven, Gradle(project dependency)
Python: pip install 
JavaScript: npm, yarn
