# Pythonic Functions
> The very first tool programmers use in Python is the function. It is the very first basic concept that we learned to
> use the keyword 'def' to define a function. Functions can break a large program into small, reusable pieces of code. Also,
> Python functions have some extra features(might be unique to Python) we can use to make our programming life easier.
### Section 1.1 Never unpack more than three variables when function return multile values
```python
item1, item2, item3 = (1, 2, 3)
```
### Section 1.2 Use Positional arguments flexibly.
