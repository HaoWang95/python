What is PEP8 -> Python Enhancement Proposal #8, known as PEP8.
PEP8 is the style guide for how to format Python code.
Note: We can always write Python code any way we want, as long as there is no error in the code.
But PEP8 works as a consistent style enhancement that makes our code more consistent and approachable. And it also makes
sure all Python users share the format guideline to follow.
Homework: read pep8.
