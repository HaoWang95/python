Pythonic thinking(We've briefly covered this before).
Pythonic aims to describe code that follows a particular style. The style has emerged over time through exercise
using the language and working with others.
The best phrase to illustrate what Pythonic is is to import this.

Programmers familiar with other languages may try to write Python as if it's C#, C++, Java, or whatever they know
best. New programmers may still getting comfortable with the vast range of concepts that can be expressed in Python.
