# Comprehension 
Python provides a special syntax called comprehensions to process lists, dict key-value pairs and sets. Comprehension is
encouraged in Python code because it significantly increase the readability of code.

# Section 1.1 Use comprehensions instead of map and filter
This is probably our first time to introduce map and filter. The reason we need to know the basics of map and filter is
these two functions are the fundamental blocks of processing sequence-like, stream-like or array-like items in other 
programming languages.
> To achieve the same purposes like we want in the class, comprehension can be a good one-line solution 
> Map and filter is an advanced solution as well, but it requires complex code logic and function call composition
